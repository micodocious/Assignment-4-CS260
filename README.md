  - an add function that takes a value and inserts it into a given position into the list
    - add(number, position)

  - a remove function that takes a position and removes the value stored at that position of the list and returns it
    - remove(position)

  - a get function that takes a position and returns that value without removing it
    - peek()


2. Be sure to include at least one test function for each piece of functionality that should verify that your code is working!  This should be at least one test per behavior, likely more.  You can make these tests in a source file with a main where your tests are either directly in the main or inside their own standalone functions (please do not neglect the importance of testing!)

3. Analyze the complexity of your implementation with line-by-line analysis
